# Cost tagging enforcement module
# Attaches a mandatory tagging policy to an AWS account or OU to ensure
# all resources are tagged with cost-center, environment, team, and service.
# Required before any cost allocation or chargeback reporting is accurate.
#
# Usage: Apply at the AWS Organizations root or per-OU for multi-team enforcement.
# This pattern is a standard approach for reducing unattributed spend in large,
# multi-region deployments; no production metrics are claimed here.
