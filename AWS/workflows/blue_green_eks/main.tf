# Blue-green migration: Elastic Beanstalk -> EKS
# This workflow reproduced the DeviceCloud zero-downtime cutover:
#   1. EKS cluster and target group already running in parallel
#   2. ALB listener rule shifted from Beanstalk TG to EKS TG in one apply
#   3. Beanstalk env decommissioned after validation
#
# Traffic shift is controlled by target_group_weight -- start at 0,
# gradually increase while monitoring 5XX rates, then flip to 100.
