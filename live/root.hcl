# letting Terragrunt auto-detect.

# No remote_state block here on purpose: each source workflow under AWS/, GCP/,
# AliCloud/, and OpenStack/ already declares its own backend (see their
# versions.tf/main.tf), matching how this repo's workflows are meant to be run
# standalone too, not only through Terragrunt. This root config's job is DRY
# inputs and environment layout, not backend generation.
